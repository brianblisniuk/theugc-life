# AUTOPILOT STATE

**Last verified main:** `0d176e42a7487c24c42f7d448f1fb3b3912535e3` (merge of PR #49, 2026-10-12)  
**State:** AWAITING_MERGE_DECISION (the schema name for waiting on a human merge). PR #50, branch `feat/b07-slice1-rules-engine`. Implementation head recorded in `.grok/autopilot-state.json` is `d574157eba0e484aa4c37cdd3aacb368e842b2db`. Live GitHub outranks this file, including if a later commit on this PR moves the head.  
**Current frontier:** B07 slice 1. The owner authorized a deterministic rules engine (D075, reconciliation only). No external model runs, and no provider receives Gmail data. Model-backed inference remains gated. This slice is not the whole of B07.

## Main history note (not rewritten)
- `0844874` (`docs: update autopilot state after PR #44 merge`) reached `main` by
  **direct push without a PR**. This violates the process in
  `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md` (push to main requires owner approval).
  The content is docs-only (`docs/AUTOPILOT_STATE.md`) and CI passed on it. History is
  not rewritten; the violation is recorded here and the rule is made explicit in
  `AGENTS.md` / `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md`.
- Since 2026-10-12, `main` is protected by repository ruleset **`main-protection` (id 24915605, active)**:
  PR required (0 approvals), required status check `verify`, no force push (non_fast_forward), no deletion, no bypass actors.

## Next action
- B07 slice 1 is PR #50 (`feat/b07-slice1-rules-engine`). State is AWAITING_MERGE_DECISION. Do not merge it from automation.
- Model-backed B07 inference and B08 stay gated.
- Non-blocking residuals are listed in `.grok/autopilot-state.json` → `unresolved_findings`. BASE-N10 (stale tracker §9) is corrected in this PR.
- **State updates ride in each block's closing PR** (no standalone state PRs).
- Owner interaction happens only via human-frontier labels.
