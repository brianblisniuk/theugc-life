# AUTOPILOT STATE

**Last verified main:** `186f4cdb98b79278a52258abe23ec96afb88483a` (merge of PR #45, 2026-10-12)  
**Open PRs:** this state-update PR only  
**State:** BASELINE TRUST AUDIT NEXT — no product block in progress.  
**Current frontier:** baseline trust audit of PR #40–#45 plus current main.

## Main history note (not rewritten)
- `0844874` (`docs: update autopilot state after PR #44 merge`) reached `main` by
  **direct push without a PR**. This violates the process in
  `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md` (push to main requires owner approval).
  The content is docs-only (`docs/AUTOPILOT_STATE.md`) and CI passed on it. History is
  not rewritten; the violation is recorded here and the rule is made explicit in
  `AGENTS.md` / `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md`.
- Since 2026-10-12, `main` is protected by repository ruleset **`main-protection` (id 24915605, active)**:
  PR required (0 approvals), required status check `verify`, no force push (non_fast_forward), no deletion, no bypass actors.
