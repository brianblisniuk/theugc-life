# AUTOPILOT STATE

**Last verified main:** `4062170212beb8b978a248ef219eb91ddbfb080b` (merge of PR #52, 2026-10-12)  
**State:** AUDITING. PR #54, branch `docs/c01-intelligence-fact-contract`. The work order asked for AWAITING_AUDIT. `.grok/autopilot-state.json` has no `AWAITING_AUDIT` value, so the machine state is `AUDITING`. `expected_head` stays null because this commit cannot name itself. Live GitHub is the head to verify. Do not merge.  
**Current frontier:** C01 — proposed intelligence event/fact contract (D077). Docs only. No migration and no runtime. D077 is Proposed and requires owner acceptance. It is not Accepted. D01 (PR #52, migration `0046`) is merged. B08 is a separate open PR (#53, D076) and is not this block.

## Main history note (not rewritten)
- `0844874` (`docs: update autopilot state after PR #44 merge`) reached `main` by
  **direct push without a PR**. This violates the process in
  `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md` (push to main requires owner approval).
  The content is docs-only (`docs/AUTOPILOT_STATE.md`) and CI passed on it. History is
  not rewritten; the violation is recorded here and the rule is made explicit in
  `AGENTS.md` / `docs/AUTONOMOUS_ENGINEERING_SYSTEM.md`.
- Since 2026-10-12, `main` is protected by repository ruleset **`main-protection` (id 24915605, active)**:
  PR required (0 approvals), required status check `verify`, no force push (non_fast_forward), no deletion, no bypass actors.

## Next action
- C01 is PR #54 (`docs/c01-intelligence-fact-contract`, D077, Proposed, docs only). State is AUDITING (awaiting audit). Do not merge from automation. D077 is not accepted.
- D01 is merged (PR #52). B08 incremental sync is open as PR #53 (D076) and is not this block. Pilot KPIs remain an open owner question. Model-backed B07 inference stays gated.
- Non-blocking residuals are listed in `.grok/autopilot-state.json` → `unresolved_findings`.
- **State updates ride in each block's closing PR** (no standalone state PRs).
- Owner interaction happens only via human-frontier labels.

## PLAY
Owner may send `PLAY` at any time. Orchestrator must resume from live GitHub + this file without asking for block selection.
